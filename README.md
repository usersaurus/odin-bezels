# Odin bezels

Add Retroarch bezels to your Odin and say NO to these black bars :)

## Getting started

- Copy the `Retroarch` folder content
- Paste it in your `Retroarch` folder (it should be in the root of your Odin's internal storage)
- Move your rom files to the `roms` folder

And that's all :)

## Examples

### Game Boy

### Game Boy Color

## Notes

- If you want to keep your rom files in another place (external storage or another folder in your internal storage) you just need to rename your rom folder with **exactly the same name** that you can find in the `roms` folder. So, for example, if your **Game Boy Color** folder is called `Game boy Color` you'll need to rename it to `gbc`

## FAQ

### The overlay disappears as soon as I press any button

You probably have the Retroarch option "Hide Overlay When Controller is Connected" enabled. You can fix this going to `settings > On-Screen Display > On-Screen Overlay` and disabling `Hide Overlay When Controller is Connected`
